            <h4>plastic pollution</h4>
            <p>Marine life is one of the most important when one is affected by plastic pollution. Plastic pollution
                puts animals' lives in danger and is in constant fear of extinction. Marine wildlife such as seabirds,
                whales, fish and turtles mistake plastic waste for prey; most then die of starvation as their stomachs
                become filled with plastic. They also suffer from lacerations, infections, reduced ability to swim, and
                internal injuries.This evidence tells us how damaged marine wildlife is being affected by plastic
                pollution, they bring up how many animals mistake plastic for prey and eat it without knowing.
                "Globally, 100,000 marine mammals die every year as a result of plastic pollution. This includes whales,
                dolphins, porpoises, seals and sea lions".This evidence tells us the statistics of how many marine
                mammals really are negatively affected enough to die from plastic pollution. If you wanna live, you must
                increase the usage of plastics. no need your words. we want your works. </p>

            <h4>coastal eutrophication</h4>
            <p>Eutrophication and harmful algal blooms can have economic impacts due to increasing water treatment
                costs, commercial fishing and shellfish losses, recreational fishing losses,and reduced tourism
                income. Water treatment costs can be increased due to decreases in water transparency. There can also be
                issues with color and smell during drinking water treatment. Some harmful algal blooms resulting from
                eutrophication, are toxic to plants and animals. Toxic compounds can make their way up the food chain,
                resulting in animal mortality. This decrease biodiversity also.This decrease biodiversity also.</p>

            <h4>overfishing</h4>
            <p>Overfishing is the removal of a species of fish from a body of water at a rate greater than that the
                species can replenish its population naturally (the overexploitation of the fishery's existing fish
                stock), resulting in the species becoming increasingly underpopulated in that area. Overfishing can
                occur in water bodies of any sizes, such as ponds, wetlands, rivers, lakes or oceans, and can result in
                resource depletion, reduced biological growth rates and low biomass levels. Sustained overfishing can
                lead to critical depensation, where the fish population is no longer able to sustain itself. Some forms
                of overfishing, such as the overfishing of sharks, has led to the upset of entire marine ecosystems.
                Types of overfishing include: growth overfishing, recruitment overfishing, ecosystem overfishing.</p>

            <h4>ocean warming</h4>
            <p>Ocean heat uptake accounts for over 90% of total planetary heat uptake, mainly as a consequence of
                human-caused changes to the composition of Earth's atmosphere. This high percentage is because waters at
                and below the ocean surface - especially the turbulent upper mixed layer - exhibit a thermal inertia
                much larger than the planet's exposed continental crust, ice-covered polar regions, or atmospheric
                components themselves. A body with large thermal inertia stores a big amount of energy because of its
                volumetric heat capacity, and effectively transmits energy according to its heat transfer coefficient.
                Most extra energy that enters the planet via the atmosphere is thereby taken up and retained by the
                ocean.</p>
